⚙️ Installation and Setup


🛠️ Issues & Debugging

❌ If "Browse Books" Shows "Page Not Found"

Ensure <BrowserRouter> is wrapped around <App /> in main.jsx.

Add this to vite.config.js (if needed):

export default {
  server: {
    historyApiFallback: true,
  },
};

Restart the server:

npm run dev

❌ If "Add Book" Does Not Work

Ensure Redux is properly set up in store.jsx.

Check if the dispatch function updates the state in Redux.

Try adding console.log in Redux actions to debug.
